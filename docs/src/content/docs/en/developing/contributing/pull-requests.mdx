title: 💌 Pull Requests
description: Instructions for submitting pull requests. Please read these instructions carefully to ensure you comply with contribution standards.

When you want to propose a change to the source code, you will need to create a Pull Request on this project's GitHub
repository.

Note that if you are modifying several different parts, you should split it into multiple Pull Requests. This will make
it easier to review and merge your proposals.

You will then be asked to fill in a few fields:

## Title

The Pull Request title should briefly describe the proposed changes. Please be concise and precise. For example, to add
support for a new, fictitious provider called "FakeRegistrar," you could write something like "Add support for
FakeRegistrar provider".

## Description

For complex changes, please provide as much detail as possible. If your changes modify an existing API, you must mention
this in the description, as it may have repercussions on projects related to Domain Watchdog.

If the proposal modifies the frontend, it would be best to include screenshots (desktop and mobile versions) to better
visualize the proposal.

## Change Type

A checklist allows you to choose the type of change proposed:

```markdown
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] This change requires a documentation update
```

This checklist helps to better identify the project's impact on the PR.

## Compliance Checklist

The checklist below allows you to self-assess the conformity of your proposal before submitting it for review:

```markdown
- [x] Commit names follow the Conventional Commits convention
- [x] I have checked the entire code before submitting it
- [x] I have updated the documentation related to my commits
- [x] My code does not generate errors
```

In any case, if you experience any difficulties creating a PR, feel free to open one; we will help you ensure it
complies with these requirements.
