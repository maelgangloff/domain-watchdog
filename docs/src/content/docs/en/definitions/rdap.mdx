The **Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)** is the modern standard for accessing registration data. It was designed to replace the legacy WHOIS protocol by addressing its lack of standardization and security.

## Key Improvements over WHOIS

* **Structured Data (JSON)**: Unlike WHOIS, which returns unstructured free text, RDAP returns data in JSON format. This allows for easy automated parsing and consistent display by clients.
* **Standardized Queries**: RDAP uses RESTful web services (HTTP/HTTPS).
* **Internationalization**: Native support for non-Latin characters (IDNs).
* **Differentiated Access**: RDAP supports authentication, allowing registries to show limited data to the public (GDPR compliance) while providing full data to accredited authorities.

## Deployment Status

ICANN mandates RDAP implementation for all accredited Registrars and gTLD Registries.
While WHOIS is still widely used by legacy systems, RDAP is the authoritative source for gTLD registration data. Adoption among ccTLDs is voluntary and ongoing.
