The **Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)** is the standard application-layer protocol for allocating objects within registries over the Internet. While primarily used for domain names, it can also manage contacts and host objects.

## The Actors

### Client (Registrar)

The Registrar acts as the EPP Client. They send XML commands to create, update, renew, or delete domain names based on customer requests.

### Server (Registry)

The Registry acts as the EPP Server. It processes the commands, validates logic (e.g., "is this domain available?"), updates the central database, and returns success or error responses.

## The Protocol Mechanism

EPP uses **XML** messages transported over **TCP**, secured by **TLS**. It is a stateful protocol, meaning a session is established (Login) before commands are executed.

Common EPP commands include:

* `<check>`: Verify availability.
* `<create>`: Register a new object.
* `<info>`: Retrieve object details.
* `<transfer>`: Initiate a registrar transfer.
* `<poll>`: Retrieve asynchronous notifications from the Registry.
