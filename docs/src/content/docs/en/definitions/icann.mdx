**ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)** is the non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and security of the global Internet's unique identifiers.

ICANN acts as the primary governance body for the technical infrastructure of the DNS. Its responsibilities include:

* **IANA Functions**: Managing the allocation of IP address space and the Root Zone of the DNS.
* **Policy Development**: Facilitating the creation of global policies for the domain name system via a multi-stakeholder model.

## Managing Top-Level Domains

ICANN decides which new Top-Level Domains (TLDs) are added to the Root Zone.

* It oversees the **New gTLD Program**, which expanded the internet from a few dozen extensions (like `.com`) to over 1,000 (like `.app`, `.shop`).
* It delegates **ccTLDs** (like `.uk`, `.fr`) to specific country managers, although it has less direct control over their local policies.

## Accrediting Registrars

ICANN manages the accreditation system for Registrars wishing to sell generic TLDs. Accreditation ensures that companies handling domain registrations adhere to security, stability, and data retention standards.
