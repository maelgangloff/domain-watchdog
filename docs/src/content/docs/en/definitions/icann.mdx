**ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)** is the non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and security of the global Internet's unique identifiers.

ICANN acts as the primary governance body for the technical infrastructure of the DNS. Its responsibilities include:

* **IANA Functions**: Managing the allocation of IP address space and the Root Zone of the DNS.
* **Policy Development**: Facilitating the creation of global policies for the domain name system via a multi-stakeholder model.

## Managing Top-Level Domains

ICANN decides which new Top-Level Domains (TLDs) are added to the Root Zone.

* It oversees the **New gTLD Program**, which expanded the internet from a few dozen extensions (like `.com`) to over 1,000 (like `.app`, `.shop`).
* It delegates **ccTLDs** (like `.uk`, `.fr`) to specific country managers, although it has less direct control over their local policies.

## Accreditation of Registrars

ICANN publishes on its website [the complete list of accredited registrars](https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/accredited-registrars/list-of-accredited-registrars).

### Benefits of ICANN Accreditation

Accredited registrars are authorized to register domain names under the [generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](/en/definitions/top-level-domain/#generic-tld-gtld).
For these extensions, accreditation is an essential prerequisite for registries to grant EPP access to the registrar.

For certain [country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs)](/en/definitions/top-level-domain/#country-code-tld-cctld), ICANN accreditation is not mandatory.
This is the case, for example, with AFNIC (Association Française pour le Nommage Internet en Coopération), which has its own accreditation process described on [its website](https://www.afnic.fr/produits-services/services-associes/devenir-bureau-denregistrement-laccreditation-de-lafnic/).
This approach allows smaller organizations to operate as registrars at the national level.

### The ICANN Accreditation Process

As of today, 11 steps are required to obtain ICANN accreditation. The details of these steps are available on [ICANN’s official website](https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/accredited-registrars/how-to-become-a-registrar).
