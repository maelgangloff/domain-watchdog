**DNS (Domain Name System)** is the decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resources connected to the internet or a private network.
It acts as the "phonebook of the internet", translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable infos.

## The Hierarchical Architecture

The DNS architecture is a distributed, hierarchical database resembling an inverted tree. This structure, known as the **Domain Name Space**, is processed from right to left:

* **Root Level**: The top of the hierarchy, represented by a silent single dot (`.`) at the end of a fully qualified domain name.
* **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: The highest visible level (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.fr`).
* **Second-Level Domains (SLDs)**: The specific name registered by an entity (e.g., `example` in `example.com`).
* **Subdomains**: Further subdivisions for specific services or organizational structures (e.g., `www`, `blog`, or `api`).

## Authoritative Servers

Authoritative DNS servers hold the definitive resource records for a specific domain zone. Unlike recursive resolvers that cache answers, authoritative servers provide the original data.

When a client requests a domain, the resolution chain queries:

1.  **Root Servers**: Directs to the TLD servers.
2.  **TLD Servers**: Directs to the domain's authoritative nameservers.
3.  **Authoritative Server**: Returns the final IP address (or other record).

## GLUE Records

A GLUE record is an A (or AAAA) record **provided by the parent zone** to prevent circular dependencies. Normally, the parent zone only delegates, but here it must provide data.
They are strictly necessary when a domain's nameserver is a subdomain of the domain itself (e.g., `example.com` uses `ns1.example.com` as its nameserver). Without the GLUE record in the `.com` zone pointing to `ns1`'s IP, the resolver would be stuck in a loop trying to resolve the nameserver's name.

### Example: `ns.icann.org`

In this example, `icann.org` uses `ns.icann.org` as one of its nameservers.

To resolve `icann.org`, you must query `ns.icann.org`, but you cannot find `ns.icann.org` without first resolving `icann.org`.

When querying the `.org` TLD server (`A0.ORG.AFILIAS-NST.INFO`), the server returns the Nameserver (NS) records in the **Authority Section**, but crucially, it also provides the IP addresses in the **Additional Section**. These are the GLUE records.
