The **Domain Lifecycle** defines the statuses a domain name traverses from its creation to its deletion.
Understanding these phases is critical to prevent unintentional loss of a domain.

## The Generic Life Cycle

![Generic Domain Name Life Cycle](https://archive.icann.org/en/registrars/gtld-lifecycle.jpg)

For most Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) regulated by ICANN, the cycle follows this path:

1.  **Available**: The domain is open for registration.
2.  **Registered (Active)**: The domain is owned and functional. It can be updated, transferred, or renewed (typically 1–10 years).
3.  **Auto-Renew Grace Period**: (0–45 days) The domain expires. The owner can usually renew it at the standard rate. The domain may stop resolving (ServerHold).
4.  **Redemption Grace Period**: (30 days) The domain is deleted from the registrar but held by the registry. Recovery is possible but requires a higher **restoration fee**.
5.  **Pending Delete**: (5 days) The domain is scheduled for permanent deletion. It cannot be recovered or renewed.
6.  **Released**: The domain becomes **Available** again for public registration.

## Special Cases of some ccTLDs

Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs) operate under local regulations, leading to diverse lifecycles:

* **No Grace Periods**: Some ccTLDs enter "Pending Delete" immediately upon expiration.
* **Pre-Expiration Renewal**: Some registries require renewal fees to be paid weeks before the actual expiration date.
* **Manual Processes**: Restoration in some ccTLDs may require manual intervention and paperwork.
