A **Registry** (or Registry Operator) is the organization responsible for maintaining the master database of all domain names registered under a specific Top-Level Domain (TLD).

## Technical Roles

The Registry is the authoritative source for its TLD. Its duties include:

* **Zone File Generation**: Publishing the zone file that directs global DNS traffic to the correct nameservers for every domain in the extension.
* **IDN & DNSSEC Management**: Enforcing policies for special characters and managing the cryptographic signing of the TLD zone.
* **WHOIS/RDAP Server**: Operating the directory service that provides public information about registered domains.

## Operational Roles

Registries generally do not sell directly to the public. Instead, they:

* Define the **Acceptable Use Policies** for the TLD.
* Set the wholesale price for domains.
* Accredit and connect with **Registrars** via EPP.
