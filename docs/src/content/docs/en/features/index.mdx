On this page, you'll find a step-by-step guide to getting started with **Domain Watchdog** and exploring its main
features. The sidebar menu on the left allows you to quickly navigate between all documentation sections.

## Search for a domain name

Domain Watchdog uses the **RDAP protocol**, the modern replacement for WHOIS, to retrieve accurate information about
domain names.

## Create a Watchlist

A **Watchlist** is a collection of domain names, triggers, and optionally an API Connector.
It allows you to:
- monitor domain status changes
- receive notifications (email or webhook: Slack, Mattermost, Discord, etc.)
- optionally auto-purchase a domain when it expires

### Watchlist notifications

When a domain changes state, you’ll automatically receive a notification.  
You can also export domain events as **iCalendar** feeds.

## Create a Connector

A **Connector** is used to automatically order (backorder) a domain name using its provider’s API.

### Tracking table

The Tracking table page displays a list of all the domain names you monitor via your Watchlists.
This list is ordered, meaning the domain names are arranged according to their estimated deletion date.
