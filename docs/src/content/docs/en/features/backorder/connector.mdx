import {LinkCard, Steps} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A Connector allows Domain Watchdog to communicate with an external domain registrar’s API to perform actions such as
domain registration.

## Create a Connector

<Steps>
1. Choose an external API provider from the list of supported registrars.
    <LinkCard title="Supported registrar" description="List of supported registrars for creating a Connector" href="/en/features/backorder/supported-registrar/"/>

2. Enter the required information using the credentials obtained from your provider’s customer area
    :::tip{icon="heart"}
    A link allows you to directly access the Provider's page to retrieve this authentication information
    :::

3. Review and consent to the required terms. As a reminder, you can delete a Connector at any time from your personal space.

4. Click the button to create your Connector. **Congratulations 🎉**

## Legal considerations

These legal requirements ensure that all domain operations comply with registrar policies and applicable regulations.

Domain Watchdog acts only as a technical interface and does not serve as a payment intermediary.
Your credentials are transmitted directly to the provider’s API for domain operations.
By creating a Connector, you consent to the provider’s terms and the use of your credentials for authorized operations.

In particular, you must consent to:

- Accept the provider’s API Terms of Use
- Confirm that you are of legal age to accept these terms

Since the terms of use may change at any time, the link to these terms is always accessible on the page listing the
Connectors.
