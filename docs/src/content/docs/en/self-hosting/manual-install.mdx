## Installation

To deploy a Domain Watchdog instance, please refer to the Symfony documentation
on [How to deploy a Symfony application](https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment.html).

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.4 or higher
- PostgreSQL 16 or higher

In order to retrieve information about domain names, Domain Watchdog will query the RDAP server responsible for the TLD.
It is crucial that the Domain Watchdog instance is placed in a clean environment from which these servers can be
queried.
In particular, the DNS servers and root certificates of the system must be trusted.

1. Install dependencies:
