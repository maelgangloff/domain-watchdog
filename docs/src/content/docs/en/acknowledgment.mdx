## External Data Sources

Domain Watchdog integrates several publicly available datasets and standardized resources.
These external inputs ensure accurate domain information, consistent behavior across TLDs, and reliable monitoring.

### IANA

The project relies on IANA’s published datasets, including:

- the [complete list of Top-Level Domains (TLDs)](https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt),
- the [official list of accredited domain registrars](https://www.iana.org/assignments/registrar-ids/registrar-ids.xhtml),
- registrar IANA identification numbers and their declared RDAP endpoints.

These resources provide the foundation for consistent and up-to-date domain lookups.

### ICANN

ICANN’s [RDAP bootstrap file](https://data.iana.org/rdap/dns.json) offers a standardized mapping of each TLD to its corresponding RDAP server.
This ensures reliable RDAP queries across registries and predictable resolution for all supported domain extensions.

### RDAP Servers of the Registries

The project also depends on the RDAP services provided by individual registries.
These services supply authoritative domain registration data.
